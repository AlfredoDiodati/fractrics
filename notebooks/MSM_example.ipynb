    "The main tool in fractrics is the MSM class, an implementation of the univariate [Markov Switching Multifractal Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_switching_multifractal). The logaritmic difference between observations is modeled as the noise-adjusted square root of the product of a chosen number of latent volatility components, each following the dynamics of discrete first order markov chains, whose transition depends on geometrically-spaced Poisson arrivals, and an unconditional term, effectively being the unconditional volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such structure effectively captures the behaviour of time series with fat tails, hyperbolic correlation decay, and multifractal moments, such as the returns of many financial assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is made in JAX, simplifying parallelization of the code. Moreover, following from [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5276090) paper, the memory complexity of the forward algorithm is reduced, due to the factorization of latent states.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the model, start with an example time series. Note that the model is only defined for positive time series (as it was created to model prices of financial assets)."
